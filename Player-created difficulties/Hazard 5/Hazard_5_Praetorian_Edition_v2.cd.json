  "Name": "Hazard 5 - Praetorian Edition",
  "Description": "This is a demonstration custom difficulty that shows how to remove grunts and create a new praetorian descriptor that takes the place of grunts. The low rarity works like the grunt rarity in that it nearly guarantees praetorians get picked first for any spawns. A future version might demonstrate adjusting spawn costs and size to increase praetorian spawn counts.",
